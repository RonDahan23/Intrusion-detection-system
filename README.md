# Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

This project focuses on developing a Machine Learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to secure computer networks from cyberattacks. The system combines advanced detection algorithms, a trained Machine Learning model, and data analysis techniques to accurately identify suspicious activities and network intrusions.

## Background
The information age has led to a surge in computer network usage and diverse applications. Unfortunately, this growth has also brought a significant rise in security risks. Computer systems have numerous vulnerabilities that are expensive and time-consuming for vendors to patch. Consequently, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) that can identify abnormal network activity and attacks become increasingly important.

## System Architecture
The system consists of the following components:

- **Web Server**: Receives network packets from various sources.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Analyzes each new connection and identifies malicious communication patterns. This model can be trained on a variety of datasets containing labeled network traffic, allowing it to recognize known attack signatures and learn to detect novel threats.
- **Threat Classification System**: Determines if a specific packet poses a potential threat and classifies the attack type. The system can categorize attacks based on their origin, target, and exploit method.
- **User Interface**: Presents the user with a detailed explanation of the threat, mitigation recommendations, and safe browsing tips. The interface can be web-based or integrated into existing security dashboards.

## Communication Protocols
The system utilizes various communication protocols, including:

- **HTTP**: Transfers network packets from server to client, enabling communication between the IDS and the user interface.
- **FTP**: Transfers files between machines, which can be helpful for updating the Machine Learning model or distributing security configurations.
- **SSH**: Enables secure communication between remote computers, allowing for secure management of the IDS system.
- **TCP**: Transfers data reliably between two network endpoints, ensuring the integrity of communication between network components.
- **UDP**: Transfers data unreliably, which can be useful for specific network monitoring purposes.
- **ICMP**: Reports errors in IP packets, aiding in identifying network issues that might be exploited by attackers.

## Security Processes
The system incorporates several security processes, including:

- **Signature-based Detection**: Identifies attacks by searching for specific patterns or known exploit behaviors. This method is effective against known threats but may miss zero-day attacks.
- **Anomaly-based Detection**: Detects unknown attacks through statistical analysis of network data. By establishing baselines for normal network traffic, the system can identify deviations that might indicate malicious activity.
- **DoS Attack Prevention**: Mitigates overwhelming the system with excessive requests. The system can implement techniques like rate limiting or challenge-response mechanisms to prevent denial-of-service attacks.
- **U2R Attack Prevention**: Prevents unauthorized user privilege escalation. By monitoring user activities and access attempts, the system can identify suspicious behavior that might indicate attempts to gain unauthorized control.

## System Advantages
The system offers several significant advantages:

- **Accurate Detection**: Identifies a broad range of threats with high accuracy, combining signature-based and anomaly-based detection for comprehensive coverage.
- **Security Awareness**: Educates users about cyber threats through the user interface, providing them with information on the identified threats and recommendations for mitigation.
- **Enhanced Browsing Habits**: Helps users browse the internet more securely by providing feedback on potential risks associated with network traffic.
- **Multi-layered Protection**: Combines advanced detection techniques like Machine Learning with traditional signature-based methods for comprehensive defense.

## Conclusion
This system presents a novel and sophisticated solution for securing computer networks against cyberattacks. The integration of Machine Learning, advanced data analysis techniques, and diverse communication protocols enables accurate threat detection, multi-layered protection, and increased user awareness.
